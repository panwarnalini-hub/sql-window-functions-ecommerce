![cover](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/panwarnalini-hub/sql-window-functions-ecommerce/main/cover.png)  

##  Project Overview  
This project explores **SQL Window Functions** in a realistic **e-commerce business scenario**.  
As a Data Analyst, your role is to uncover insights about customer behavior, employee performance, and sales trends.  

The project demonstrates how SQL can be applied to business-driven questions similar to **Kaggle-style challenges**.
